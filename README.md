# Shapelets-as-VirtualSequences-TSC

This repository contains a novel algorithm for time series classification. It was a part of my Master's thesis at University of Georgia, USA.

Here we implement the idea of Virtual Sequences using the actual values of Shapelets. The intuition was to separate time series samples of different class far from each other.
